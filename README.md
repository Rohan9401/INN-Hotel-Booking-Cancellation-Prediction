# INN-Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
## Problem Statement:
A chain of hotels, INN Hotels Group, is facing a problem of inventory loss due to booking cancellations, resulting in revenue loss. They want to build a Data Science solution that will help them predict the likelihood of a booking getting canceled so that they can take measures to fill in potential vacancies.

## Business Context and Problem Definition:

## Business Context:
With the increasing popularity and ease of access to online hotel booking platforms, customers tend to make reservations in advance to avoid any last-minute rush and higher prices. These online platforms offer flexible cancellation options, in some cases even a day before reservation. To compete with this, even offline bookings have increased the flexibility in cancellations. This has led to an increase in the growing number of cancellations, with one of the primary reasons being last-minute changes in travel plans. These sudden changes can result from unforeseen circumstances, such as personal emergencies, flight delays, or unexpected events at the travel destination.

Hotel booking cancellations become a crucial problem to solve as it leads to revenue loss and operational inefficiencies. The cancellation of bookings impacts a hotel on various fronts:

1. Loss of revenue when the hotel cannot resell the room

2. Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms

3. Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reduced profit margins

## Problem Definition:
The INN Hotels Group has been contending with the challenge of rising cancellations for nearly a year now. However, the last three months witnessed a **rise in inventory loss due to cancellation rise to an all-time high of 18%**. This has led to a jump in the **revenue loss to an all-time high of approx. \$0.25 million annually**. This has significantly impacted their profit margins.

- In the current context, inventory refers to a hotel room, and the inability to sell one leads to inventory loss

The group has been using heuristic mechanisms (rule and domain expert-based) to try and reduce the revenue loss due to cancellations, but this hasn't been effective so far hasn't been effective (neither efficient nor scalable), as evident from the magnitude of losses they are incurring.

The group has decided that they **need a Data Science-based solution to predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled** as they expect it to be more effective than their current mechanism. They hope that this proactive approach will help them significantly **minimize revenue loss and improve operational efficiency**.
